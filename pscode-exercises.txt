// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

print


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

List even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,etc.)

Even numbers can be divided by 2.
Odd numbers cannot be divided by 2.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 1 2 3 4 5
b) average is 3
c) minimum is 1, maximum is 5
d) add all 5 numbers together (equals 15), then divide by how many numbers were there (5), giving you 3.
